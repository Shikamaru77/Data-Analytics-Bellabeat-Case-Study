## Bellabeat Case Study

**Introduction**

This case study is the culmination of my work as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project. Following the 6 phases of Data Analysis, I present an analysis of Bellabeat's fitness data.

**Summary**

Bellabeat, a pioneer in women's health technology, develops innovative smart devices for tracking various aspects of women's well-being. These devices offer insights into activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health. This case study aims to analyze fitness data generated by Bellabeat's smart devices and identify growth opportunities, focusing on the Bellabeat app's integration.

**Objectives**

The main business task is to identify trends in consumer use of Bellabeat devices and shape the marketing strategy. Stakeholders include Bellabeat's co-founders and the Marketing Analytics team. We seek to understand smart device usage trends, their benefits to customers, and how they inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

**Dataset and Preparation**

The FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, available on (Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit], is used for analysis. We address potential limitations due to the dataset's small size and absence of demographic info. Initial data selection focuses on user activity levels and daily metrics.

**Analysis**

The analysis reveals insights such as user activity distribution, steps per weekday, and fitness metrics. Users display varying activity levels, with room for improvement. Steps per weekday fall short of recommended levels. The data underscores the importance of an active lifestyle for health.

**Conclusions**

Trends in smart device usage provide valuable insights for Bellabeat's target audience of women. Engaging exercise routines and strategic notifications could enhance user engagement. The insights guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy towards user-centric products and fostering a supportive community.
